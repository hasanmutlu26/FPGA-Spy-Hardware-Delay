# Hardware Trojan Detection Using Delay Ratio Method on FPGA
This project explores the detection of hardware trojans using delay-based methods
on FPGAs. The study builds upon a previous project and addresses challenges while
exploring various scenarios. It investigates the impact of trojan position on delay
values, finding minimal effects with one-unit differences being insignificant and twounit differences notable. The study also examines the influence of different trojan
locations on the chip, observing varying in-chip variations across devices and noting
the trojan’s detectability in most cases. Additionally, the use of ring oscillators to
detect trojan hardware among different chips is explored, showing significant variations
across devices and confirming the method’s effectiveness in identifying trojan hardware.
Overall, the study highlights the potential of delay-based methods for trojan detection
on FPGAs and suggests avenues for future research.
